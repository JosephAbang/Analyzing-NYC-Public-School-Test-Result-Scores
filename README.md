#  Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores
## BY Daatacamp Projects x Joseph Abang

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

I looked at how performance varies by borough, identified how many schools fail to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the city!

## Summary of findings
 * There are only ten public schools in New York City with an average math score of at least 640.
 * Stuyvesant High School (754) emerged as the highest in average math score. 
 * This top writing score was at the same school that got the top math score, Stuyvesant High School. Stuyvesant is widely known as a perennial top school in New York.
 * There are four schools with average SAT scores of over 2000!
